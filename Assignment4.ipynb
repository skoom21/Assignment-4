    "\n",
    "This hospital management system successfully implements GDPR principles through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary patient data is collected and stored\n",
    "2. **Purpose Limitation**: Data is used only for healthcare management\n",
    "3. **Storage Limitation**: Patient data is retained appropriately\n",
    "4. **Integrity & Confidentiality**: Fernet encryption protects sensitive diagnosis data\n",
    "5. **Accountability**: Comprehensive audit logging tracks all data access and modifications\n",
    "6. **Data Subject Rights**: Anonymization feature supports right to erasure\n",
    "\n",
    "### CIA Triad Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidentiality**: Role-based access control, data masking, encryption\n",
    "- **Integrity**: Audit trails, input validation, secure storage\n",
    "- **Availability**: Error handling, backup capabilities, reliable database operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Encryption System**: Fernet-based reversible encryption for diagnoses  \n",
    "✅ **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Doctor, Receptionist with appropriate permissions  \n",
    "✅ **Data Anonymization**: Masking functions for privacy protection  \n",
    "✅ **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking for compliance  \n",
    "✅ **Streamlit UI**: User-friendly dashboards for different roles  \n",
    "✅ **Database Security**: SQLite with proper error handling  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All core functionalities have been tested and verified:\n",
    "- Database initialization ✅\n",
    "- User authentication ✅\n",
    "- Patient management ✅\n",
    "- Encryption/decryption ✅\n",
    "- Role-based views ✅\n",
    "- Audit logging ✅\n",
